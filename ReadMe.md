# X's Repos

```
A remake / downgrade of my previous github repos project with VueJs.
This spa returns the repositories of a github user.
Insert the user's name and you'll get all of his public repositories.
```

[GitRepos VueJS](https://github.com/ZTF666/GithubRepositoryLister) .

[Live Demo](https://gitlister.web.app/)

```
This time using only jquery and basic js.
No authentication , just unauth requests to the api .
this was made during a small tutoring session i made for a friend .
```

## Setup

```
minimal setup required .
Edit the part where it says {USER_NAME} with yours or someone else's and you're done .

```

## EDIT : this was changed later on with the search feature implemented .

```
there's no need to edit anything anymore .
```

## Limitations

```
Since the request doesn't implement an authentication , you're gonna be limited to 60 requests/hour .
and authentication bumps that to 5K/hour if i recall .
good luck
