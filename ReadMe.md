# My github repos

```
A remake / downgrade of my previous github repos project with VueJs.
 (https://github.com/ZTF666/GithubRepositoryLister) .
  this time using only jquery and basic js.
No authentication , just unauth requests to the api .
this was made during a small tutoring session i made for a friend .
```

## Functionnalities

```
Search 👀 : looks up a user on github and displays all of his PUBLIC repos .
```

```
Export 📥 : exports a user's public repos into a CSV file .
```

## Setup

```
minimal setup required .
Edit the part where it says {USER_NAME} with yours or someone else's and you're done .

```

## EDIT : this was changed later on with the search feature implemented .

```
there's no need to edit anything anymore .
```

## Limitations

```
Since the request doesn't implement an authentication , you're gonna be limited to 60 requests/hour .
and authentication bumps that to 5K/hour if i recall .
good luck
```
